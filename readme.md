# GitHub House Rules

1. When creating a branch, follow the naming convention. Work Item could be a component, page or a section of the UI library you are working.
 
    <name>/<work_item> or example aaron/alerts

2.  Only the owner of that branch can create a Pull Request

3. Create Only a Pull Request if your copy/branch is working

4. After approved Pull Request, the one who approved should inform the team that they should update their local master copy through WhatsApp Group only.

5. Approving of Pull Request should be first comes first serve. If you are Approver of Pull Request #10 and there is still Pull Request #8 and #9. Wait for #8 and #9 to be approved and merged.

6.  Do not modify a branch that is not owned by you, only if you have a permission for cases like the owner of that branch is asking for help.

7. Use the comment to encourage one another wether you approved a Pull Request or disapproved Pull Request. #RESPECT is our core values.

8. If you need help, reach out for help. We are a #TEAM.
